Scrum Thoughts:

  - Scrum (and Agile) generally seems to be much more suited to the real world than many other theories of organizing things 
  - Seems very practical and down-to-earth (for example the emphasis on responding quickly to changes and unforseen problems)


Pair Programming Thoughts:
  - Pair Programming is a new skill and will take some time to master
  - Differing levels of technical ability between the pair may create both problems and opportunities
  - The rapport between the pair is probably more important than the actual technical levels
  - Staying in the roles is not easy!
