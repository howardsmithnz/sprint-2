 Give an example of a time in your life where you've shown empathy for another.
 
   - A while ago a friend had an important long-term relationship end for him in an unexpected way. I was able to share with him that I had previously experienced something similar. 
 
 Was it difficult?
 
   - Actually in this case it wasn't so difficult as I think we were both ready to chat about this topic
 
 Was it worth it? Why or why not?
 
  - Yes, absolutely. He has since been able to move on in a very constructive way, and I feel that I was able to help him do this.
