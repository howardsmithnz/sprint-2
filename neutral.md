Achieving Equity Through Gender-Neutral Language

What do you think?
  - There are many sensible reccomendations here however I would like to add that a key consideration is context.
  - For example, phrases that would be suitable at a casual barbeque may not be appropriate in a professional context and vice versa
  - I think in modern NZ English "guys" is often used with a non-gender specific meaning (I have frequently heard female speakers address their female friends with "Hi guys!")
  
  
  
Do you make an effort to use gender neutral language?
  - It depends on the context. In a professional setting I usually do.
  
What do you think when you hear non-gender-neutral language?
  - In a professinal setting I usually think that it makes the speaker seem a little old fashioned. If the speaker is from an older generation then I do understand why they use this language. If they are from a younger generation then I think that they are a little bit out of touch!
