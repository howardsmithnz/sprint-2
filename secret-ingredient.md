What social capital is

  - In this article it is defined as "the trust, knowledge, reciprocity and shared norms that create quality of life and make a group resilient"
  - Although I think it's worth pointing out that this may vary quite a bit depending on cultural contexts (i.e. Would all these things be valued the same in China, Japan, Germany, France, etc.?)
  - Another way to look at it may be "the degree to which people can communicate effectively with each other"
  
How important do you think trust and empathy are to your success in life?
  - Ideally I would like to think that they are very important, however in reality this has depended on the culture of the various organizations that I have been associated with. In the best of these social capital was valued and therefore trust and empathy could flourish. In other organizations this was sadly not always the case.
