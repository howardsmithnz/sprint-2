Key Principles of User Centred Design
Most Important:
  - be consistent - an inconsistent interface is very irritating to use
  - reduce unnecessary mental effort by the user - the users are busy with their work, they won't appreciate having to do extra
  
Less Important:
  - use simple and natural dialogue - this seems to be obvious anyway
  
Surprising:
  - reduce errors - I thought that more error information was better (within reason)

The ROI of User Experience
What suprised me?
  -That so much money can be lost by bad user experiences
  -The "stakeholder politics" issue was no surprise!
  
Does this change your view of web and software development?
  -Sooooo.....GOOD User Design must be very valuable...more than I thought
  
What about the other 9 reasons why software projects fail? Hmmm.....
