Most Important:
  - be consistent -an inconsistent interface is very irritating to use
  - reduce unnecessary mental effort by the user - the users are busy with their work, they won't appreciate having to do extra
  
Less Important:
  - use simple and natural dialogue - this seems to be obvious anyway
  
Surprising:
  - reduce errors - I thought that more error information was better (within reason)
