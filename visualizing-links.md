What is the rule for underlining text that is not a link?
  - DON'T! Don't underline text that is not a link.

How should the unvisited link color compare to the visited link color in terms of:
Brightness;
Hue;
Visibility to color-blind users.
  - Unvisited links should be more vivid and brighter than visited links which should be duller
  - Blue is a widely accepted colour for links. Unvisited and visited links should be a related colour
  - Unvisited links should be brighter and more luminous to assist colour-blind users

What is a "perceived affordance"?
  - This is the quality of an object that suggests what it might be used for. (e.g. blue underlined text might be a link)

When can you safely eliminate underlines for links?
  - in obvious places such as navigation menus and other lists

Should you use blue for text? Why or why not?
  - No. It is generally recognized by most users as being a link

If for some shocking reason, your contextual links are not underlined (horrors!), what can you do to improve link discovery by users?
  - You could change the link when the user hovers the cursor over it. Such changes could be underlining or presenting a link title box

What are link titles and how might you use them?
  - A link title is a small dialog box which appears when the user hovers the cursor over a link. It may include extra information about the link
